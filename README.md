# Classifying Heart Disease Using Logistic Regression

Heart disease is a major public health issue in Western societies, leading to significant societal challenges such as increased healthcare costs and loss of productivity. Its multifactorial nature, influenced by lifestyle, genetics, enironment, and other factors, requires innovative approaches for effective management and prevention.

Machine learning, especially logistic regression applied to bulk patient data, presents a promising solution. This technique enables the identification of subtle patterns and risk factors in large datasets, which might not be evident through traditional analysis methods.

By leveraging logistic regression, healthcare professionals can develop predictive models to assess an individual's risk of heart disease. This facilitates early intervention, personalized treatment plans, and optimized resource allocation, ultimately aiming to reduce the societal impact of heart disease.

This project follows that track, creating a model used to catch high risk patients that aren't already under the care of a clinician.
